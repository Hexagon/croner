# Supporting Croner through Sponsorship

---

Croner was founded and is actively maintained by [Hexagon](https://github.com/Hexagon). While I've poured my heart and soul into the project, I'm deeply grateful to the broader community of [contributors](https://github.com/Hexagon/croner/graphs/contributors) who have collaborated to make Croner what it is today.

## Why Sponsor?

Your sponsorship directly supports my ongoing efforts to enhance and improve Croner. By becoming a sponsor, you're fostering a broader open-source ecosystem and ensuring it remains free and accessible to all.

## Sponsorship

You can support by **monthly** and **one-time** sponsorship tiers at [github.com/sponsors/Hexagon](https://github.com/sponsors/Hexagon?frequency=one-time&sponsor=Hexagon)

- **Monthly Tiers**: These tiers offer benefits such listing in Croner's README, priority issue resolution, and more.

- **One-Time Contributions**: More relaxed option with buying Hexagon anything from a coffe and up. Each contribution, no matter the size, ensures continued dedication to the project.
